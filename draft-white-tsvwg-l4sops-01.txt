       Operational Guidance for Deployment of L4S in the Internet
                      draft-white-tsvwg-l4sops-01

Abstract

   This draft is intended to provide guidance to operators of end-
   systems, operators of networks, and researchers in order to ensure
   successful deployment of L4S in the Internet.  It includes mechanisms
   that are intended to promote reasonable fairness between L4S and
   Classic flows sharing a single-queue [RFC3168] bottleneck link.  This
   draft identifies opportunites to prevent and/or detect and resolve
   fairness problems in such networks.

1.  Introduction

   In the majority of network paths, including paths where the
   bottleneck link utilizes packet drops (either due to buffer overrun
   or active queue management) in response to congestion, as well as
   paths that implement a 'flow-queuing' scheduler such as fq_codel
   [RFC8290] or CAKE, and those that implement dual-Q-coupled AQM, L4S
   traffic generally coexists well with classic congestion controlled
   traffic.

   On network paths where the bottleneck link instead implements a
   shared-queue (FIFO) with an Active Queue Management algorithm that
   provides Explicit Congestion Notification signaling according to
   [RFC3168], it has been demonstrated that when a set of long-running
   flows comprising both "Classic" congestion controlled flows and L4S-
   compliant congestion controlled flows compete for bandwidth, the
   classic congestion controlled flows may achieve lower throughput when
   compared to the L4S congestion controlled flows.  This 'unfairness'
   between the two classes appears to be more pronounced on longer RTT
   paths (e.g. 50ms and above) and/or at higher link rates (e.g. 50 Mbps
   and above).

Internet-Draft          L4S Operational Guidance           November 2020


   The root cause of this unfairness is that [RFC3168] does not
   differentiate between packets marked ECT0 (used by classic senders)
   and those marked ECT1 (used by L4S senders), and provides an
   identical congestion signal (CE marks) to both classes, while the L4S
   architecture redefines the CE mark and congestion response in the
   case of ECT1 marked packets.  The result is that the two classes
   respond differently to the CE congestion signal.  The classic senders
   expect that CE marks are sent very rarely (e.g. approximately 1 CE
   mark every 200 round trips on a 50 Mbps x 50ms path) while the L4S
   senders expect very frequent CE marking (e.g. approximately 2 CE
   marks per round trip).  The result is that the classic senders
   respond to the CE marks provided by the bottleneck by yielding
   capacity to the L4S flows.  While this has not been demonstrated to
   cause starvation of the classic flows, the resulting rate imbalance
   can be demonstrated, and could be a cause of concern.

2.  Per-Flow Fairness

   There are a number of factors that influence the relative rates
   achieved by a set of congestion controlled flows sharing a queue in a
   bottleneck link.

   TODO: discuss startup & convergence times, short flows, RTT-
   unfairness, differences in deployed CC algorithms, etc.

   TODO: also mention that flow sharding is commonplace, so per-flow
   fairness does not imply per-application fairness

   Comments received: per-end-host fairness or per-customer fairness may
   be more important than per-flow fairness

3.  Operator of an L4S host

   Support for L4S involves both endpoints: ECT1 marking & L4S-
   compatible congestion control on the sender, and ECN feedback on the
   receiver.  Between these two entities, it is incumbent upon the
   sender to evaluate the potential for unfairness and make decisions
   whether or not to use L4S congestion control.  The receiver is not
   expected to perform any testing or monitoring for unfairness, and is
   also not expected to invoke any active response in the case that
   unfairness occurs.

   The responsibilities of and actions taken by a sender may strongly
   depend on the environment in which it is deployed.  This section
   discusses two scenarios: a constrained environment and an
   unconstrained environment.

   TODO: also need to discuss how/when to re-enable L4S if it becomes
   disabled

3.1.  CDN Servers

   Some hosts (such as CDN leaf nodes and servers internal to an ISP)
   are deployed in environments in which they serve content to a
   constrained set of networks or clients.  The operator of such hosts
   may be able to determine whether there is the possibility of
   [RFC3168] FIFO bottlenecks being present, and utilize this
   information to make decisions on selectively deploying L4S.
   Furthermore, such an operator may be able to determine the likelihood
   of an L4S bottleneck being present, and use this information as well.

   For example, if a particular network is known to have deployed
   [RFC3168] FIFO bottlenecks, deployment of L4S should be delayed until
   those bottlenecks can be upgraded to mitigate any potential issues as
   discussed in the next section.

   If a particular network offers connectivity to other networks (e.g.
   in the case of an ISP offering service to their customer's networks),
   the lack of RFC3168 FIFO bottleneck deployment in the ISP network
   can't be taken as evidence that RFC3168 FIFO bottlenecks don't exist
   end-to-end (because one may have been deployed by the end-user
   network).  In these cases, deployment of L4S will need to take
   appropriate steps to detect the presence of such bottlenecks.  At
   present, it is believed that the vast majority of RFC3168 bottlenecks
   in end-user networks are implementations that utilize fq_codel or
   Cake, where the unfairness problem does not exist.  While this
   doesn't completely eliminate the possibility that a [RFC3168] FIFO
   bottleneck could exist, it nonetheless provides useful information
   that can be utilized in the decision making around the potential risk
   for any unfairness to be experienced by end users.

   o  Prior to deploying L4S on servers:

      *  Consult with network operators on presence of [RFC3168] FIFO
         bottlenecks

      *  Consult with network operators on presence of L4S bottlenecks

      *  Perform downstream tests per access network

         +  Tests (TBD) to detect absence of RFC 3168 (TODO: need more
            discussion about test methodologies and their implications
            (complexity, accuracy, etc.)).

         +  Enable AccECN feedback for TCP, but enable/disable L4S per
            access network

   o  In-band [RFC3168] detection and monitoring: (cite: Fallback Tech
      Report)

      *  Real-time response (fallback)

      *  Non-real-time response (disable for future connections)

3.2.  Other hosts

   Hosts that are deployed in locations that serve a wide variety of
   networks face a more difficult prospect in terms of identifying the
   presence of RFC3168 FIFO bottlenecks.  Nonetheless, steps can be
   taken to minimize the risk of unfairness.

   Methods that can be deployed include:

   o  In-band [RFC3168] detection (and possibly fallback)

   o  Per-dst path test:

      *  For a connection capable of L4S feedback

      *  If CE feedback, perform active test (TBD) for [RFC3168]
         presence

   Since existing studies have hinted that RFC3168 FIFO bottlenecks are
   rare, detections using these techniques may also prove to be rare.
   Therefore, it may be possible for a host to cache a list of end host
   ip addresses where a RFC3168 bottleneck has been detected.  Entries
   in such a cache would need to age-out after a period of time to
   account for IP address changes, path changes, equipment upgrades,
   etc.

   It has been suggested that a public blacklist of domains that
   implement RFC3168 FIFO bottlenecks or a public whitelist of domains
   that are participating in L4S experiment could be maintained.  While
   this may be possible, a number of significant issues would need to be
   addressed, not the least of which is the fact that presence of
   RFC3168 FIFO bottlenecks or L4S bottlenecks is not a property of a
   domain, it is the property of a path between two endpoints.

4.  Operator of a Network

   While it is, of course, preferred for networks to deploy L4S-capable
   high fidelity congestion signaling, and while it is more preferable
   for L4S senders to detect problems themselves, a network operator who
   has deployed equipment in a likely bottleneck link location (i.e. a
   link that is expected to be fully saturated) that is configured with
   an [RFC3168] FIFO AQM can take certain steps in order to improve rate
   fairness between classic traffic and L4S traffic, and thus enable L4S
   to be deployed in a greater number of paths.

4.1.  Configure AQM to treat ECT1 as NotECT

   If equipment is configurable in such as way as to only supply CE
   marks to ECT0 packets, and treat ECT1 packets identically to NotECT,
   or is upgradable to support this capability, doing so will eliminate
   the risk of unfairness.

4.2.  Configure Non-Coupled Dual Queue

   Equipment supporting [RFC3168] may be configurable to enable two
   parallel queues for the same traffic class, with classification done
   based on the ECN field.

   Option 1:

   o  Configure 2 queues, both with ECN; 50:50 WRR scheduler

   o  Queue #1: ECT1 & CE packets - Shallow immediate AQM target

   o  Queue #2: ECT0 & NotECT packets - Classic AQM target

   o  Outcome

      *  n L4S flows and m long-running Classic flows

      *  if m & n are non-zero, get 1/2n and 1/2m of the capacity,
         otherwise 1/n or 1/m

      *  never < 1/2 each flow's rate if all had been Classic

   This option would allow L4S flows to achieve low latency, low loss
   and scalable throughput, but would sacrifice the more precise flow
   balance offered by [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-aqm-dualq-coupled].  This option
   would be expected to result in some reordering of previously CE
   marked packets sent by Classic ECN senders, which is a trait shared
   with [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-aqm-dualq-coupled].  As is discussed in

Internet-Draft          L4S Operational Guidance           November 2020


   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-l4s-id], this reordering would be of very low
   risk.

   Option 2:

   o  Configure 2 queues, both with AQM; 50:50 WRR scheduler

   o  Queue #1: ECT1 & NotECT packets - ECN disabled

   o  Queue #2: ECT0 & CE packets - ECN enabled

   o  Outcome

      *  ECT1 treated as NotECT

      *  Flow balance for the 2 queues the same as in option 1

   This option would not allow L4S flows to achieve low latency, low
   loss and scalable throughput in this bottleneck link.  As a result it
   is a less prefered option.

4.3.  WRED with ECT1 Differentation

   This configuration is similar to Option 2 in the previous section,
   but uses a single queue with WRED functionality.

   o  Configure the queue with two WRED classes

   o  Class #1: ECT1 & NotECT packets - ECN disabled

   o  Class #2: ECT0 & CE packets - ECN enabled

4.4.  ECT1 Tunnel Bypass

   Using an RFC6040 compatibility mode tunnel, tunnel ECT1 traffic
   through the [RFC3168] bottleneck with the outer header indicating
   Not-ECT.

   Two variants

   1.  per-domain: tunnel ECT1 pkts to domain edge towards dst

   2.  per-dst: tunnel ECT1 pkts to dst

Internet-Draft          L4S Operational Guidance           November 2020


4.5.  Disable RFC3168 ECN Marking

   While not a recommended alternative, disabling [RFC3168] ECN marking
   eliminates the unfairness issue.  Clearly a downside to this approach
   is that classic senders will no longer get the benefits of Explict
   Congestion Notification.

4.6.  Re-mark ECT1 to NotECT Prior to AQM

   While not a recommended alternative, remarking ECT1 packets as NotECT
   ensures that they are treated identically to classic NotECT senders.
   However, this also eliminates the possibility of downstream L4S
   bottlenecks providing high fidelity congestion signals.

5.  Researchers

5.1.  Detection of Classic ECN FIFO Bottlenecks

   can distinguish FIFO from FQ.
